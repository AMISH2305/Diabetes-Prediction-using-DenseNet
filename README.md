Utilized a comprehensive dataset of diabetic and non-diabetic patients with features such as BMI and glucose level.
Addressed class imbalance by pre-processing the data to ensure an equal number of diabetic and non-diabetic patients.
Trained a DenseNet deep learning model on the balanced dataset.
Applied the trained model to the same dataset to predict diabetic and non-diabetic patients.
Achieved an accuracy rate of approximately 91% in the model's predictions.
